Anyone can contribute HTML elements to the library. Every element from contributors is verified individually before being added. Sites that aren't safe for work or encourage piracy will be rejected.

General guidelines:
- Do not block an element that modifies the useful content of the page.
- Social icons should be blocked, but icons for sites that are utility focused such as LinkedIn and RSS should be preserved when possible. Blocking all icons takes priority over preserving utility focused icons.
- Offers, deals, and promotions should be blocked.
- Empty ad boxes should be blocked.
- Newsletter inserts are blocked unless they are part of the footer of the page. If there is a button in the footer that links to a separate page just for newsletters, then all other newsletter footers can be removed.
- Blank areas of the page that do not contain content and pad out the site should be removed when possible.
- Block donation pop-ups and inserts, but don't block donation buttons (*except for university sites, they have enough already*).
- Feedback buttons should be blocked, except when specifically on docs/tutorial/help pages.
