Anyone can contribute HTML elements to the library. Every element from contributors is verified individually before being added. Sites that aren't safe for work or encourage piracy will be rejected.

General guidelines:
- Do not block an element that modifies the useful content of the page.
- Social icons should be blocked, but icons for sites that are utility focused such as LinkedIn and RSS should be preserved when possible. Blocking all icons takes priority over preserving utility focused icons.
- Offers, deals, and promotions should be blocked.
- Empty ad boxes should be blocked.
- Newsletter inserts are blocked unless they are part of the footer of the page.
- Blank areas of the page that do not contain content and pad out the site should be removed when possible.
