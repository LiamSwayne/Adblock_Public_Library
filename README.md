# Adblock Community Library
This project is a collection of HTML elements that can be plugged into Adblock Plus to improve the Adblock experience. Most of the elements in the library are included to remove distractions and irrelevant information (social icons, popups, newsletter inserts, etc). This is a community library, meaning anyone can contribute. Every element from contributors is verified individually before being added.

Steps to implement library:
1. Install [Adblock Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus-free-ad-bloc/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb).
2. In the extension settings > general: turn off acceptable ads.
3. In the extension settings > advanced > filter lists: Enable "ABP filters", "EasyList", "EasyPrivacy", "Fanboy's Notifications Blocking List", "Fanboy's Social Blocking List", and "I don't care about cookies".
4. In the extension settings > advanced > My Filter List: copy and paste any of the lists below into the "search or add filters" box.
